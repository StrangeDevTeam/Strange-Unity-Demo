# Strange-Unity-Demo

Hello there, this project is a Unity package designed to make the development of games much easier - specifically RPG games.
the system is entirely modular and you can activate and deactivate the different modules as you please.

in this unity package you can:
 - create a basic third person player in seconds!
 - use my custom built an interaction engine to handle all interactions to keep your code clean.
 - utilise a dialogue system for RPG-style games with minimal programming.
 - create custom items and attach inventories to entites for better item management.

Coming Soon:
 - use a questing system alongside the dialogue system to give the player tasks and rewards for completing tasks
 - create shops for the user to buy and sell items

## History

this project used to be called 'StrangeEngine', but since then i have begun working on my own standalone engine in directx11 called StrangeEngine so this project was renamed to 'StrangeUnity', or just 'Strange' for short

## Why use Strange?

Strange was built with speedy game development in mind. If you are a decent programmer, you can probably build a better system that is more purpose-built for the game you want to make. but this takes a lot of experience planning a time.
Strange has an easy-to-use API and documentation that coveres how to do nearly everything in the unity package.

With Strange, you can have a basic world, NPC interaction a decent character controller, a fully customisable camera system, a dialogue system that is infinately expandable and allows the use of a response wheel so the player can choose how they are to respond to a NPCs dialogue like Syrim or the witcher. all after about 15 minutes of following the documentation.

it is also Free to use, fully open source and it teaches you the basics of Object Orientation. as long as you know the basics of programing, you will be able to use this package to make a game in no time at all!
the hardest part about making a game with this package is finding/making assets, and thinking up a good storyline.

if you are a video game artist/modeller and know even just a little of programming, this tool is perfect for you - you can combine all of your assets in your own custom made world to tell a story
